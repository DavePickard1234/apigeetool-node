  "readme": "# volos-oauth-apigee\n\nThis is an OAuth 2.0 implementation for the Volos family of modules that uses Apigee as its source\nof data. That is, information about valid application IDs and secrets, and the access tokens themselves,\nare stored in Apigee.\n\nWhen run locally, this module makes API calls to Apigee to access this information. That makes this\nthe right OAuth module to use when building OAuth-enabled applications to run on the Apigee product,\nbecause when the application is deployed to Apigee itself, it will use all the same data as any other\nApigee application.\n\nThis module actually exports the same programming interface as \"volos-oauth-common\" -- see that module\nfor detailed documentation.\n\n## Installing the Adapter\n\nThis module depends on an \"adapter,\" which is a special API that is deployed to Apigee for your specific\norganization in the Apigee cloud. This proxy is hosted in the Volos GitHub repo, which is here:\n\n[https://github.com/apigee/volos](https://github.com/apigee/volos)\n\nThe proxy is inside the \"proxy\" directory. Instructions for deploying it may be found here:\n\n[https://github.com/apigee/volos/blob/master/samples/basic/README.md](https://github.com/apigee/volos/blob/master/samples/basic/README.md)\n\n### oauth.create(options)\n\nThe module exports one function, called \"create\". It takes an argument called \"options\" with the following\nparameters:\n\n* uri: The full URI of the Apigee adapter that you deployed in the last step. For instance, if the organization\nname is \"foo\" then this might be \"https://foo-test.apigee.net/adapterproxy\".\n* key: An API consumer key for a valid \"application\" that is part of the same organization where the adapter\nwas installed.\n\nThe result of this call will be an \"OAuth\" object, which may be used according to the interface defined\nby the \"volos-oauth-common\" module.\n\n## Deploying to Apigee\n\nThe \"apigeetool\" that you installed while setting up the adapter may also be used to deploy the application to\nApigee. For instance, the following command deploys the script named \"oauthtest.js\" to the organization named\n\"foo\" in the \"test\" environment:\n\n    apigeetool deploynodeapp -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -o foo -e test -n argo-oauth -b /BASEPATH -m oauthtest.js -d .\n\n\n",
